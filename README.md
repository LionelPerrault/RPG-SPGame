#Dungeon 12
This is 2D top-down rpg game with "old school" gameplay based on table game D12 which used two dices with 6 edges.

#Little Story
Six years ago it was console-interface game (which u can get through 'master' branch). And now sequel got 2D graphics with a few graphical engines (AvaloniaUI, SkiaDraw, Monogame).

#Platform
This game based on a "game engine" written by my own. It have much wrong decisions, but no one of this don't bring much troubles. All of this, i think, 100% is open source. 
It's written by C# .net core 2.1 without any .NET Framework part.

You can try to use this engine separetly of D12 game, but i think it take some time to separate core. (This work will ended after first beta-version of game)

#Gameplay
The core of the gameplay is action rpg. You have a hero who can have his own storyline, with four abilities. And your goal is to reach the end of the scenario in an open world.

But the main feature of this game is the ability to change its class throughout history. At the start, you can get one of the three base classes, but in the first version of the game it will be something around twelve ordinary, and four epic.

In spite of all this, the completed gameplay will contains parts from: Might and Magic VI-VIII, Action-rpg, some good rpg games like Dragon Age, and some of old Rogue-like games.
